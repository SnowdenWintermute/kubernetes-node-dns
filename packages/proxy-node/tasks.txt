1. Receive updates from zone nodes
    a.  Updates will be in the form of "publishable state", unique to each client
2. Compress update packets (make use of packet-manager library)
    a.  Round down / use only INTs not floats
    b.  Send only deltas
        i.  Keep a copy of what was sent and compare new updates to see changes
    c.  Send only large deltas
    d.  Give queue priority to the most drastic changes
    e.  Can skip sending any changes below a certain threshold of change
    f.  Can send less frequent updates about non-targeted or far away entities
3. Distribute update packets to clients
    a.  Distribution should be spread out over some miliseconds
4. Receive messages from clients

Notes:
- Client nodes can be shared by multiple realms
- Can use multiple threads
- Option to implement CPU-consuming anti-cheat here to reduce load on zone nodes
